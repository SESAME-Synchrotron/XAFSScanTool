The introduction of ZnSe is expected to enhance the hydrogen-evolution activity and stability of TiO2-x in visible light. The authors expect the differences in the titanium to be mainly in the interfaces with the ZnSe. However, XAFS is a bulk technique, and the titanium environment in the bulk TiO2-x will dominate the XAFS signal. As there are only two samples to be measured, the number of shifts have been reduced to 3. We suggest more time is spent in putting together a stronger well constructed proposal.",Not allowed,,

The scientific subject is very interesting and highly topical, and XAFS is a very suitable technique for the sort of studies the authors are proposing. In addition, the authors mention that they are planning to measure four samples, but there is no description of those anywhere in the proposal. They are also planning to measure three different absorption edges, Co and O K-edges and the La M-edges. O edge is not feasible.

The experiment is interesting, and EXAFS will be useful to determine the structure of the material once the Al and the Cu have been etched with the acid treatment. However, it is not clear in the proposal how many samples are going to be studied, or the concentration of the precious metals in the thin films.",Not allowed,,
