Welcome to HESEB Scanning Tool's documentation!
===============================================
This is a documentation for the scanning tool that collects experimental data from XAFS/XRF (X-ray Absorption Fine Structure/X-ray Fluorescence) spectroscopy beamline. The tool has been developed by data collection and analysis team of SESAME in collaboration with control team.

This documentation is targeting beamline end-users and scientists.

The scanning tool is GUI based that helps users to easily understand the scanning parameters and thus saving the time of explaning how to get XAFS-XRF experimental data.
